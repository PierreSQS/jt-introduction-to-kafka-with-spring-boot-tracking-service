# Introduction to Kafka with Spring Boot - Tracking Service

This repository contains the example code and assignment samples to support the Introduction to Kafka with Spring Boot online course, for the Tracking Service portion of the course.

The associated repository for the Dispatch Service can be found here:  [Dispatch Service Repository](https://github.com/lydtechconsulting/introduction-to-kafka-with-spring-boot)

The application code is for a message driven service which utilises Kafka and Spring Boot 3.

It is used to help students learn how to produce and consume messages in Java using Spring Kafka and Spring Boot 3.
The course provides step by step instructions and detailed explanations for students to build up the code themselves.
This repository provides the code to support the course broken down section by section using branches, allowing students to
compare and contrast the code they create with the lesson code in the branches.

As you work through the course, please feel free to fork this repository to your own GitHub repo. Most lectures contain links
to source code changes. If you encounter a problem you can compare your code to the lecture code. See the [How to Compare Branches](https://github.com/lydtechconsulting/introduction-to-kafka-with-spring-boot/wiki#how-to-compare-branches) section in the Wiki
